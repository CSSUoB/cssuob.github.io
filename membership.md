# Membership

To take part in our bigger, ticketed events, you'll want to purchase a
membership 🎉 It's £5 for the whole year and all of your membership money goes
to running great events for other members, a lot of it going on pizza!

You'll also get a snazzy green role 🟢 on the [Discord](/discord)!

If you have any problems getting a membership, ask in #help on our Discord
server, the Guild website can occassionally be a little temperamental!

Interested in seeing our historical membership statistics and some fun graphs? Check them out [here](/membership-stats)!

As a student member, you'll be able to vote in our elections (held during
our AGMs and EGMs) and run for a position on the committee.

To join, you can purchase a membership on the [Guild of Students CSS page](https://www.guildofstudents.com/studentgroups/societies/css/)
using your Student Login.

## 🧑‍🏫 External Membership
<br>
<b> Please note that since the Guild's recent antics with external memberships the information below is now out of date and we will work to update it as soon as the Guild provides us with more information. </b>
<br>
<b>
While we wait for them to update their policies, you can find the most recent announcement [here](https://www.guildofstudents.com/news/article/website/Guild-Statement-Confirmation-of-the-reintroduction-of-External-Memberships/) </b> <br>

As an external member, you'll be able to support the society, and of course,
you'll be welcome at all of our events.

To join, you'll first need to sign up with a Guest Membership, and then upgrade
it to an External Membership on the [Guild of Students membership page](https://www.guildofstudents.com/about/memberships/).
As part of the process to get a Guild External Membership, you'll need to
submit a form to explain why you believe you should be included as a member.

Then, you can purchase an external membership from the [Guild of Students CSS page](https://www.guildofstudents.com/studentgroups/societies/css/).
