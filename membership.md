# Membership

To take part in our bigger, ticketed events, you'll want to purchase a
membership 🎉 It's £5 for the whole year and all of your membership money goes
to running great events for other members, a lot of it going on pizza!

You'll also get a snazzy green role 🟢 on the [Discord](/discord)!

If you have any problems getting a membership, ask in #help on our Discord
server, the Guild website can occasionally be a little temperamental!

Interested in seeing our historical membership statistics and some fun graphs? Check them out [here](/membership-stats)!

# What's the difference?

</div>

<div class="section-box" markdown="1">

## Standard Member

You're automatically considered a standard member if you're a registered student at UoB. 
This also includes if you're only a part-time student or resitting internally.

</div>

<div class="section-box" markdown="1">

## External Member

Anyone who doesn't fall into the above category (i.e. if you're not a student) is considered an external member.
This also includes those resitting externally, on a leave of absence, or university staff.

External members can do everything that standard members can, except vote in elections and run for committee positions.

# Sounds great! How do I do it?

## Standard Membership

As a registered student (as we explained above) you're automatically a member of the Guild so don't need to do anything before joining! 

To join, you can purchase a membership on the [Guild of Students CSS page](/join) using your Student Login.

## External Membership

The process for external memberships is a bit longer and will vary depending on your circumstances.

1. Firstly, everyone will need to create a "Guest Account" on the guild website. You can do that [here](https://www.guildofstudents.com/about/memberships/).

2. Once you've done that, you'll need to click the "Apply for External Membership" button on the same page and this is where the process deviates.

3. If you're a member of staff, an external student, or a student on a leave of absence all you'll need to do is provide your university email address to be verified. Once this is done you can skip straight to step 5.

4. If you don't fall into the categories mentioned in step 3 (i.e. you're an alumnus, or a student at another university) you'll need to provide a [basic DBS check](https://www.gov.uk/request-copy-criminal-record) issued within the last 3 months and a letter of recommendation from a current Standard Member. 

5. Finally, once you're application has been accepted, you'll be able to head over to the [Guild of Students CSS page](/join) and purchase a membership using the login credentials you used for your Guest Account, which you created in step 1.
