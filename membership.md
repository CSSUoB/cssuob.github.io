# Membership

To take part in our bigger, ticketed events, you'll want to purchase a
membership 🎉 It's £5 for the whole year and all of your membership money goes
to running great events for other members, a lot of it going on pizza!

You'll also get a snazzy green role 🟢 on the [Discord](/discord)!

If you have any problems getting a membership, ask in #help on our Discord
server, the Guild website can occassionally be a little temperamental!

As a student member, you'll be able to vote in our elections (held during
our AGMs and EGMs) and run for a position on the committee.

## 🧑‍🏫 External Membership

As an external member, you'll be able to support the society, and of course,
you'll be welcome at all of our events.

To join, you'll first need to sign up with a Guest Membership, and then upgrade
it to an External Membership on the [Guild of Students membership page](https://www.guildofstudents.com/about/memberships/).
As part of the process to get a Guild External Membership, you'll need to
submit a form to explain why you believe you should be included as a member.

Then, you can purchase an external membership from the [Guild of Students CSS page](https://www.guildofstudents.com/studentgroups/societies/css/).
