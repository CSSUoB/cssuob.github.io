  <h1>Why CSS?</h1>
  <p>CSS is one of the largest departmental societies at the University of Birmingham, with a
    large online and physical presence in the School of Computer Science.
    <br><br>
    With technology growing and innovating every year, Birmingham is becoming the powerhouse
    of the tech sector, and CSS is here for it - from connections to the local tech community
    and the British Computer Society (BCS) to FTSE 100, we're able to run events and talks to
    help those at the university considering a career in technology.
    <br><br>
    Each year, we're working with companies of all scales to deliver intriguing and informative
    events, from CV workshops to company talks. If you're a recruiter looking to reach out to
    students in the heart of the U.K., why not email us?

    <h2>Reach Young Talent</h2>
    <p>Did you know that the University of Birmingham has had its Computer Science department ranked
      3rd in the country for research in 2024? With a mix of undergraduates, PGTs or PhD students, CSS
      has a diverse range of students that challenge themselves in hackathons, Capture the Flag contests,
      and many more, regularly achieving the best.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="benefit text-container">
    <h2>Run Events that Inspire</h2>
    <p>From talks to workshops and Q&As to hackathons, you're in control of the events you do with CSS.
      As long as you provide the speakers, we'll provide a venue and the publicity to make your event
      stand out!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="benefit text-container">
    <h2>Excellent Engagement</h2>
    <p>In 2023/24, we had 392 members join the society, and projected to have even more this year, but that is not only what we are excelling in -
      our events, both industrial and social, have smashed records and expectations this year, with over 170 at our ball.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="benefit text-container">
    <h2>Show off the best of your technology!</h2>
    <p>Technology is what we are especially passionate about at CSS, and our members always look to learn more about it in
      the real world! Have the opportunity to boast your involvement with technology and teach students about real-life scenarios
      they would otherwise not encounter at university.</p>
