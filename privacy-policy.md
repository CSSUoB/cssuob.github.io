All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.


### 2. How Do We Process Your Information?

**In Short:**
We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our services, and to comply with law. We will also use your information to communicate with you. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.

We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:
 * **To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts.** We may process your information so you can create and log in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.
 * **To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.** We may process your information to provide you with the requested service.

### 3. What Legal Bases Do We Rely On To Process Your Personal Information?

**In Short:**
We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate interests.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
 * **Consent.** We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. [Learn more about withdrawing your consent](#withdrawing-your-consent).

 * **Vital Interests.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.


### 4. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?

**In Short:**
We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us to keep your personal information for longer than eighteen (18) months past the termination of the user's account.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.


### 5. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?

**In Short:**
We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.


### 6. What Are Your Privacy Rights?

**In Short:**
In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Switzerland), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the [How Can You Contact Us About This Notice?](#9-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice) section below.

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the [How Can You Contact Us About This Notice?](#9-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice) section or updating your preferences.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
