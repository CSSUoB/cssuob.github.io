Hey there! 👋

We're the *award-winning* Computer Science Society **(CSS)** at the University of Birmingham.

Created and run by students for students, our goal is to provide a warm and
friendly community in which we (and you!) can socialise, develop our tech
skills and find opportunities to develop our careers! ✨ Keep an eye out for
our dinosaur mascot [TeX](/tex)!

We can't wait to see you at our events!

❤️ The CSS [Committee](/committee)
