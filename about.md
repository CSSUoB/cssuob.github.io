# About us

Welcome to the **Computer Science Society**! We are the departmental society
in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham.

We are one of over 300 Guild of Students societies and one of 35+ EPS College
societies. Being a student is not just about working hard, you have to enjoy
it too! That is why CSS is working making sure to create events and provide a
medium through which computer scientists can meet, make friends, and partake
in a whole lot of exciting activities.

## What we do

We run a variety of events around the year, such as:

* Parties and Food Nights
* Quiz Nights
* Games Nights and LAN Parties
* Hackathons
* Careers and Tech Talks
* Workshops
* and much more!

We also organise special events, such as trips, Christmas meals, the annual
CSS Ball and others! We are always completely open to suggestions too, so if
there's an event you would like to see, just let us know.

Most importantly, we also provide lots of **free pizza** at many of our
events. We reckon that in 2018/19, we provided almost 500kg of pizza to our
members (but that's just a guess, so please so don't quote us).

## How to get involved

Membership through the Guild only costs Â£5 for the whole year. You can go to our page on the \[Guild of Students](https://www.guildofstudents.com/studentgroups/societies/css/) website to purchase your membership. Membership gives you access to all of our events and you also get a free CSS T-shirt!

Each year we hold an AGM (Annual General Meeting) in March to elect our
committee for the year. We have a variety of different roles, which you can
check out on our Committee page. We also hold another election at the start
of the academic year to elect a new First Year Rep and PGT Rep.

Every event we run will be advertised on our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram,
as well as via. the Calendar page on our website. Stay tuned for all of
the latest updates!

## Hackathons

A hackathon is a (usually 24 hours) event in which teams work together to
create a piece of software for certain challenges, to win awesome prizes.
They are a great way to meet new people, talk with different companies and
learn new things. Each year we encourage members to get involved with
hackathons since it's a great way to learn, build and share.

To learn more about hackathons, checkout the great [MLH](https://mlh.io)
website for more info about events happening all over the world.
