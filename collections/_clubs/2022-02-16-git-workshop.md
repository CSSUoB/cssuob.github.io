Victoria and Dan hosted a "Git Workshop" as an introduction for first years and second years to Git - a version control system widely used in industry and by ourselves.

In the workshop, they covered installing git, making commits, need-to-know git commands, merge requests and more! Towards the end of the event, we carried on workshop tradition by having all the attendees fork a repo and sign the [guestbook](https://github.com/CSSUoB/GDSCGit) by making a pull request.
