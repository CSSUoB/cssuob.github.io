[Will](https://twitter.com/wrussell1999) ran a fantastic introduction to
Android app development with Java, covering all the basics that make mobile
apps tick ðŸŽŠ.

During the workshop, we explored setting up a development environment,
creating a basic guessing game app, and previewing it in the Android
emulator.
