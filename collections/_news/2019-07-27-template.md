This post is a sample post.

To make this into a real post, copy the content of this file, change any
relevant details, such as the title, thumbnail and header photo and then modify the
content. To publish the post, remove `published:false` from the front matter.

The header photo should be specified, if not then it is hidden.

<img class="post-image" src="/assets/header-images/computer-science-building.jpg">

Images can also be placed with the class `post-image` for 100% width and auto height.

The rest can be formatted in Markdown.
