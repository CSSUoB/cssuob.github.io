Hey everyone! 😀 

Exciting news: we have an **Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM)** coming up to **elect THREE roles**! 🗳️ 

Always wanted to get involved with CSS? Why not come along and stand for **First Year Rep, PGT Rep, or International rep** — we'd love to have you! 🙌


The EGM itself will be **taking place on our Discord** 👾 at **14:00** on **Wednesday 28th October**. 

You **need to be a [member](https://cssbham.com/join)** to run for a position 🏃‍♀️ or vote, and if you're standing, you also need to prepare a short (< 2 minute) speech. 💬 

If you want to run, please send an email notifying [t.a.goodman@cs.bham.ac.uk](mailto:t.a.goodman@cs.bham.ac.uk) ASAP (though you can run from the floor)... 📧 

If you have any more questions 🤔 please feel free to get in touch with one of the committee — we're more than happy to help!

You can also find descriptions of each of the roles up for grabs [here](/constitution).

Good luck! 

— The CSS Committee ❤️
