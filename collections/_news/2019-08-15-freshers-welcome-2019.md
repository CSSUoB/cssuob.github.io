Congratulations on your place to study at the University of Birmingham - we
look foward to seeing you all in September!

# What is CSS?

CSS is the departmental society for the School of Computer Science, and one
of the over 300 student groups which are part of the Guild of Students. Being
a student is not just about working hard, you have to enjoy it too! That is
why CSS is working making sure to create events and provide a medium through
which computer scientists can meet, make friends, and partake in a whole lot
of exciting activities.

# What events do you run?

We run a variety of events, including but not limited to:

- Parties & Food Nights
- Quiz Nights
- Games Nights/ LAN Parties
- Hackathons
- Careers & Tech Talks
- Workshops
- CSS Ball

We also organise special events, such as trips, Christmas meals and others.
We are also completely open to suggestions, so if there is an event you would
like us to host, just let us know! We also provide free pizza at almost every
event, last year reaching half a ton of pizza eaten by our members.

# How do I get involved?

Our membership costs only £5 for one year. This gives you
access to all of our events and you will also get a CSS T-Shirt. We will also
be holding some elections at the start of the semester, and we need a First
Year Rep, so if you think this sounds like something you would be interested
in, keep your eyes peeled for announcements in the first weeks.

# Freshers’ Week

Freshers’ Week is the perfect opportunity for you to get involved with the
society, as well as meeting the other people on your course. To make sure
that you have the best Freshers’ Week possible, we are hard at work
organising some awesome events for all of you. There will be much more
information once you get here, so make sure you keep your eyes peeled during
Freshers’.

# Hackathons

A hackathon is a (usually 24h) event during which teams create a piece of
software for certain challenges given by companies, which may win them
awesome prizes! They are a great way to meet new people, talk with companies
of all sizes, including the likes of IBM, Google and others, and learn new
things while developing your project. Each year we encourage our members to
come to hacktahons, some of them being organised by us. Two of the most
important ones are the Google Hash Code, which we organise each year in our
campus, and HackTheMidlands (visit [hackthemidlands.com])

HackTheMidlands will take place at the end of October, and it is one of the
biggest hackathons held in Birmingham. The tickets are free, and CSS has some
reserved for our members. (Just use the code “CSSUOB” at checkout).
