Hey there! 👋

First of all, huge congratulations on being accepted to study at the University of Birmingham! 🎊

We are CSS (Computer Science Society), the award-winning departmental society for the School of Computer Science.🏅All of our events are awesome and organised by fellow students! ✨ Here’s just a taste of what we’ve done before: 

* Parties and Food Nights 🎊
* Tech Workshops 👨‍💻👩‍💻
* Hackathons 💻
* Careers Talks 📈
* Games Nights/(W)LAN Parties 🎮
* Quizzes 🤓
* Women in Tech Events 🙍‍♀️
* CSS Annual Ball 🕺
* End of Year BBQ 🍔

## Why should I join CSS?
CSS is a huge community that you’ll definitely want to be involved in! It’s an amazing way to make new friends and build your tech skills! 😜

We’ve got loads of events planned for you guys (starting with a huge freshers quiz 🤯)!

You can join CSS through the Guild of Students at [cssbham.com/join](https://cssbham.com/join) for just £5! 😱

## How do I get involved? 
This year, to keep you safe (for at least the first term), we’ve moved all our events online to our very own Discord Server! 👾 

You can join our Discord at [cssbham.com/discord](https://cssbham.com/discord). We’d ❤️ to see you there!

After you’ve joined, make sure you introduce yourself in the #introductions channel! 😉

## Hackathons
We encourage all our members to take part in these really cool events called ‘Hackathons’! 💻

“What’s a hackathon?” I hear you ask... It’s best described as an ‘invention marathon’ where people can learn, build and share their creations over the course of a weekend (or however long the Hackathon is) in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.

You don’t have to know anything about programming to get involved! In fact, hackathons always have something to cater for new programmers. ⌨️

For CSS members, there is (at least one) hackathon each year which is a must: [HackTheMidlands](https://hackthemidlands.com)! In fact, you can already grab a free ticket [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hackthemidlands-50-tickets-111222359070).
