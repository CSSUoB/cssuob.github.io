# Points of Contact

Hey!

This year, CSS have put together a list of â€˜volunteersâ€™ for you all. Simply put, they are friendly faces you
 can chat with ðŸ˜ƒ

The committee is always happy to be contacted by any member of the CS community, but this year in particular we
 thought it'd be a good idea to collate some more members together to make sure that everyone has someone that
  they can go to.
   
Everyone here is happy to be contacted, so feel free to get in touch with any questions you
may have that you donâ€™t want to post publicly in our #help channel on our [Discord](https://cssbham.com/discord).
If you just want to chat to someone who is also doing CS at UoB, theyâ€™ll be up for that as well!

### Bio
I've somehow survived 3 years of the horrific mismanagement of both the school and the committee. Thanks to that
 I am here to dole out survivorship bias tainted advice! 
(Editorâ€™s note: Max is being mostly sarcastic about the committee mismanagement. ;) )

I am in my final year of CS. I like making games in Unity, knitting and video games. Before Covid I enjoyed

### Bio
Hi, I'm Katie, a fourth year student doing the Integrated Masters course! I love the Sims and PokÃ©mon
 (ask me about PokÃ©soc!). Academically, I'm interested in Human Computer Interaction and Virtual Reality. 
 I also do NaNoWriMo, if anyone else is interested in doing that!

### Bio
I'm a female CS student on the MSci course with a year in industry, going into my second year. I believe I'm 
friendly and approachable, and always keen to help others out! I'm also a student ambassador for the School of 
Computer Science, part of the Wayfarers hiking society, and on the committee for the Wing Chun Kung Fu club.
 I enjoyed the CSS events that I attended in my first year, and am looking forward to getting more involved this
  year. I'd love to be able to help new students with any questions they might have, and show them what CSS has
   to offer them!

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex. I've been a Student Ambassador and a Student Rep for the past 3 years, so I know my way around 
the department and who to contact about weird questions or difficulties you're facing. I'm currently on a year
 in industry so not in lectures this year but you can still contact me whenever ðŸ˜Š
