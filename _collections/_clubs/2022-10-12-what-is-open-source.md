Justin gave a workshop on why open source is awesome and how to contribute to open source projects. ðŸ’» 

During the workshop, we explored the benefits of open source, how to find open source projects to contribute to, 
and how to contribute to them, ultimately culminating in 
[pull request #352](https://github.com/CSSUoB/cssuob.github.io/pull/352) to the CSS website!
