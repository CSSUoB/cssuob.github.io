CSS member Matt gave a fantastic talk, sharing his enthusiasm for OpenStreetMap. Matt explained how anyone can submit edits to the map to improve its data. 

The talk was followed by a ‘mapathon’ inspired by the charity Missing Maps, to aid workers on the ground that previously relied on poor-quality maps in order to know where to send aid. We spent a few hours improving OpenStreetMap in the area of Chad and making pizza disappear!
