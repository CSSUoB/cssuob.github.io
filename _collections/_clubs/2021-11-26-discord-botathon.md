Following the growing success of our [Discord server](/di), we ran 2 related Discord Bot events.


#### Discord Bot Workshop

On Friday evening, we gave members a crash course on all things `discord.py`, giving them all the tools they needed to make a discord bot themselves. 
We also recorded an [online version](https://youtu.be/yVxKmp40sjo) for people who couldn't attend in person.


#### Discord Botathon

On the Saturday, we ran a 5 hour Discord Bot Hackathon with teams making their own bot using knowledge from the day before.
The winners won a Raspberry Pi Zero each, but everyone was the real winners as we all got plenty of pizza.
