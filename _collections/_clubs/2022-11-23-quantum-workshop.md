[Dr. Miriam Backens](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~backensm/), lecturer and researcher at UoB, gave an introductory talk 
to quantum computing. We covered the basics of quantum computing, some of its applications, and the theory behind 
programming a quantum computer. 🤯

Then, IBM gave us a tour of their quantum computing SDK, [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), and we got to play around 
with builing our own quantum circuits and running them! ⚛️  

The slides from Miriam's talk are available on
[their personal webpage](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~backensm/intro_to_QC_2022.pdf).
