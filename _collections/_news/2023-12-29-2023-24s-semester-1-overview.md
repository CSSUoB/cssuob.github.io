What a start to the year it's been!

As always for CSS, it's been a hectic start to the year, from welcoming freshers to electing a new President and First Year Rep, going roller-skating, and finishing the semester off with our ever-successful Christmas Meal. If you're not quite up to speed, let's catch you up with everything that happened!

# Starting Fresh
A﻿s a part of our Freshers' events, we had our yearly Board Games and Societies' Night, both major successes - whilst Societies' Night broke our record for the most attendees at the event, Board Games kicked off the start of the year with a bang, giving everyone the chance to meet new people, make new friends, and most importantly, enjoy some pizza together!

# Mid-Term Events
During October, we had a handful of other successful events, such as our collaboration with TeaSoc, Bank of America's CV Workshop, and our terrifying Halloween Quiz, all three exceeding expectations - Cream Tea had almost 100 attendees! That's a lot of tea.

# Last but not least...
The end of the semester was a bit quieter in the world of CSS, but nonetheless, we made the most of it - finishing off with our final event of the semester, the ever-so-merry Christmas Meal, hosted at the Green Man!

# Sponsor Update
We also have a quick notice from our friends at BNY Mellon about their internships and graduation schemes. We'll also be publishing the slides from the Technology of BNY Mellon event on our Discord server soon - it has a quick extract about using Spring, so if you're in 2nd Year and doing Team Project next semester, it may be worth checking the slides to know what to expect!

# Ending Remarks
G﻿oing into the new year, we have even bigger and better events lined up for non-members and members - thinking of running for PGT/PGR Rep? Ordering your thigh-high socks? Curious about the history of computer science, and its role in breaking the enigma code? Preparing your snazziest suits and dresses for the big finale of events at the end of the year? Keep an eye on our social media (such as Discord and Instagram), and we'll have news on upcoming events to follow!

I﻿n the meantime, we would like to give a heartfelt thank you to all of our members who have joined us this year, those who have joined us in social or industrial events, and of course, to those who have made the society what it is today. We look forward to seeing you again in the next semester!
