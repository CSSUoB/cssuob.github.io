Hi everyone! 
We wanted to let you know about all the CSS events coming up in the next month - it’s going to be a busy one so here’s a quick rundown:

## Escape Room 🔐

This Friday at 8pm, put your teamwork and puzzle solving skills to the test at an escape room! Tickets are available at 🔗 [https://cssbham.com/escape](/escape)🔗

## Quantum Workshop ⚛️

Interested in quantum computing? Join lecturer and researcher Miriam at 3pm on Wednesday the 23rd for a talk and get a hands-on experience programming quantum computers with IBM.
Miriam will be teaching a quantum computing module next semester for final years, so don’t miss this chance to get a taste!

## Christmas Events! 🎅

W﻿e've got lots of events coming up to celebrate this time of the year:

Hope that all sounds good!
Make sure to tell every single person you know 👀
