# Pride üè≥‚Äçüåà

On the 51st anniversary of the [Stonewall riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots), we would like to wish
all of our members a Happy Pride Month! üéä

Pride is a time when people in the LGBTQ+ community can celebrate their individuality. This year, that celebration feels a
little different; nonetheless, we would like you to join us in commemorating this wonderful event. üòÉ

Hall, who goes by the nickname "maddog", is one of the notable supporters of Unix and Linux systems, and an early
 proponent for free and open-source software. He chairs the board of directors for the Linux Professional Institute,
  a nonprofit that provides certification to open-source professionals. Hall came out as gay in 2012 in honor of the
   100th birthday of mathematician Alan Turing. Hall wrote in Linux magazine: "Most of the people in my world of 
   electronics and computers were like the mathematicians of Alan Turings' time, highly educated and not really 
   caring whether their compatriots were homosexual or not, or at least looking beyond the sexuality and seeing the 
   rest of the person."
