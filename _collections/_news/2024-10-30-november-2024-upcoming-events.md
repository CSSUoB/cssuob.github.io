Hello everyone! We hope you've been able to settle well into university.

We've had an incredible start to the semester with our Cream Tea and Halloween Quiz events, and have got to meet so many
of you. For our first session of Missing Semester, we had to book three(!!) rooms to have everyone join the event, and
we had to order 40 pizzas from Papa John's for our CS Societies Night, only to be told off for ordering too much. 
However, none of this would've happened if it wasn't for all of you. Thank you for making these events unforgettable,
as CSS would not be the same without you.

This month, we've got a big collection of events coming up, but this list isn't exhaustive - expect some surprises
around the corner!

## Lua Workshops üõ†Ô∏è - Thursday 31st October, 5pm - Y3-G29

This Thursday, we have Amrit giving the second Lua workshop that covers the following:

- The Lua C API and embedding Lua
- Making modules for Lua
- Setting up Lua in your editor
- Lua package management
- Type safety

If you missed the first talk, you can access the "slides" for it here: <https://www.frityet.net/lua-ss/> (of which we were
told were made in Lua, believe it or not)

## November EGM üó≥Ô∏è - Wednesday 6th November, 1pm - Y3-G34

Campaigning for the EGM has now begun! You can now post your manifestos, questions and constitutional amendments ahead
of the EGM into the newly opened channel on our Discord server. 

If you're considering standing for a role in the EGM, you are able to do so on the voting website: <https://vote.cssbham.com>

If you're standing or have questions for candidates, you are now able to join them in Discord, which you can do here:
<https://cssbham.com/discord> 

See you on the day!

## NQ64 üéÆ - Thursday 7th November, 7pm 

We'll be returning to NQ64 for the night! NQ64 is a drinking arcade in Digbeth with themed drinks and arcade games like
Mario Kart, Crazy Taxi, Pacman, etc. - for more information, check [NQ64's website](https://nq64.co.uk/birmingham/).

We'll also be hosting a walking train starting at 6:15pm from the Computer Science building if you're not sure of how
to get there!

If you're planning on going, please note that NQ64 only accepts driver licenses and passports for entry, and only people
18 years or older are allowed inside.

## Film Night üé• - Wednesday 13th November, 7pm - University House G12

The following week, we'll be holding a film night - break out your popcorn (if it gets approved by the Guild) and enjoy
a CS-oriented film with your friends!

Currently, we are holding a vote in [Discord](https://cssbham.com/discord) for the film to show; these include:

- Hackers (1995)
- Source Code (2011)
- Hidden Figures (2016)
- The Terminator (1984)
- 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)

Voting will be open for a week, then the film to be hosted will be announced!

## CSS x AlgoSoc üíº

We're currently working on a collaborative event with AlgoSoc to deliver important knowledge about applying to positions
in the CS industry - we'll have more details confirmed soon, so keep an eye out on CSS' and AlgoSoc's socials!

## Python Workshop üêç

We'll be looking to hold a Python workshop later in the month, hosted by none other than our wonderful Matt, who has 
held similar workshops in the past! If you're unfamiliar with Python and want to start somewhere to learn it, this will
be the best opportunity to do so.

## Pub...? Lots of pubs...?

This is one we're still in the process of confirming - keep an eye out for more information!

## Missing Semester üêß

We have more coming with our collaborative talks from us, AFNOM and contributors within SoCS! As a quick overview of
what's to come this month:

- Containers and Virtualisation, 4th November
- Shell Advanced, 11th November
- LaTeX, 18th November
- Git for Open Source Development, 25th November

Each session is being held on Mondays from 1pm to 2pm.

## Festive fun awaits 

This covers all of our events for November, but there's also some pretty significant ones waiting right around the
corner... something about advent... something about a green man and certainly dressed TeX... something about Discord 
bots...

We'll post any updates on our Discord or Instagram @cssbham - we hope you've enjoyed the events we've run so far, and
we'll see you around! 

All the love,  
\- CSS Committee
