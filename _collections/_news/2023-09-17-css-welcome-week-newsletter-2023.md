Hello everyone!

Firstly, to all freshers, congratulations on getting into UoB! I hope you have a brilliant time while you’re here. And to everyone coming back for yet another year of your degree, good to see you again, hang in there.

## What is CSS?

So, what is The Computer Science Society? CSS is a student-run society that is a large part of the CS community here at UoB. Over the year, we run a variety of events; from pub nights, to workshops, to quizzes, to the CSS ball, to a mini conference called TeX Talks, we have something for everyone. You’ll notice free pizza and drinks are running themes at CSS events! My personal favourite is an annual trip to the birthplace of computers, alternating from The National Museum of Computing and, where we're going this year, Bletchley Park!

## Welcome Week

If you’re new to CSS, come say hi! We’ll have a stand in the CS atrium every day during welcome week, and we’ll have a spot in the societies tent too on Thursday the 21st, from 11 AM to 4 PM. If you’re a fresher still learning your way around campus, have a go at our scavenger hunt! Teams that complete it get a special, *limited edition* CSS sticker. If you want to know anything else, please check out the rest of our website!

We have a ton of events in the works for freshers, so keep an eye out for updates! Just to give a taste of things to come, we’re planning a board games night in the CS building (with pizza!), a pub outing to Selly Oak, and a return of our annual trip to Ming Moon - a Chinese buffet in the city.

## Looking Forwards

The future of term 1 is looking bright, as we’ll bring back many of our classic events. You can look forward to the Halloween quiz, Christmas meal, and collaborations with other societies. We’ll also be hosting an Extraordinary General Meeting in late October, where we will elect a new First Year Rep and Post-Graduate Rep to the committee.

Speaking of the committee, I’m excited to work with the lovely people running the society this year! If you see any of us around campus, come and say hi. You can check out the committee [here](/committee).

## Join Us!

This last year, we broke many records for CSS: with over 400 members, we reached the 3rd largest Guild society at UoB; we have over 2.5k members in our discord server (and counting); and we ran 40 different events. Buying a membership gives you access to exclusive events, a green name on Discord, and a free T-shirt! Join us [here](/join).

We’ve recently updated our discord server, so if you want more updates on CSS, a place to discuss your course, or just to talk to other students, [join our server](/discord)

You can also find us on [Instagram](/instagram)

Or join our [Facebook group](/facebook)

Whether you come to just one event, or run for a role on the committee, I hope CSS can make your time at UoB spectacular.

See you later,
Archer
CSS President
