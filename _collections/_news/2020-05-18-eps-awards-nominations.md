**The EPS Awards Nominations are still open and will close on Friday!**

Many of you may still be wondering what the EPS Awards is all about, and more importantly why and who you should nominate.

## What are the EPS Awards?

The Awards is your chance to make sure CSS, our Committee, and our Members are recognised for all of the hard work we have put in to all of the amazing events you enjoyed over this last academic year. Traditionally, the Awards culminates in one big awards evening in the Great Hall after exams. However, the unprecedented circumstances this year means that the awards will be hosted virtually online on the 19th June. But don't worry, you're still welcome to dress up in your fanciest black tie at home.

There are 13 Awards up for grabs, these are:

* Sports Personality of the Year
* Sports Team of the Year 2019/20
* Outstanding Event Award
* Volunteer of the Year
* Outreach Award
* Diversity and Inclusion Award
* Industrial Award
* EPS Community Award
* Inspirational Committee Member
* Role Model of the Year
* Head of College Idea of the Year
* The Great Achievement in EPS Award
* Society of the Year 2019/20

Most of the Awards can be won by a team, a person, or an event, and they are open to anybody in the society (not just Committee Members), except for the obvious Inspirational Committee Member Award. We, as the Committee also choose a winner for a Member of the Year and Staff Member of the Year. You can also see the past winners on the Awards Website.

[See the 2019 Winners](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/eps/eps-community/students/societies-awards/2019-winners.aspx).

## Who should I nominate?

We appreciate that each member of our society may not know everything that has happened, and who made all of our great events possible. That's why we have put together a list of who we think deserves to win an Award from around Computer Science. We also know that many of the Award titles may seem ambiguous, so make sure you read the description to know what each is about.
