**Welcome to all of the new members and returning members**

It's September and the new adacemic year is about to start. That means only one thing: Freshers' Week and it's less than two weeks away!

We've got lots of fun things planned for everyone who is coming to the uni for the first time, and also everyone who is returning too.

## Freshers' Week Events

We encourage everyone to come to as many events as you can: it's a great way to meet your fellow course-mates and make some new friends. All of our events are inclusive and open to absolutely everyone no matter who you are! Below is a list of all of the events we have planned for you in the first few weeks of the semester. Also, incase you haven't seen it yet, we've updated our website (see below) and you can find the new [calendar page](https://cssbham.com/calendar) where you can see all of the events at any time.

### Ming Moon Lunch

This is our first main event! If you have been wondering what "Computer Science Society Social" is in your Welcome Week calendar, well this is it. Join us to Ming Moon, a Chinese buffer restaurant in the centre of Birmingham. This is the perfect time to get to know your coursemates and meet some great friends, all while having a nice buffet lunch. This event is open to all students in CS, not just Freshers!

We're offering two different tickets: with and without transport there. If you would rather us sort the transport for you (a train from University station to Birmingham New Street), then you can purchase the ticket with transport. We will update you soon about how you can pay - keep an eye on the Facebook event and our social media.

If you don't know how to get there, we will walk together to the train station and then to Ming Moon, departing the Computer Science building at 12:30, arriving at the restaurant by 13:00.

Time and Date: Wednesday 25<sup>th</sup> September, 13:00

Location: Ming Moon Restaurant, 16 Hurst St, Birmingham B5 4BN
