Currently, we are holding our elections for next year's committee as part of our (now online) Annual General Meeting (AGM). The committee's role within the society is to manage the group and organise all of the events which are run throughout the event - everything from the tech workshops to the big events such as our annual Ball. Committee is also responsible for managing the group's finances and recruiting new members.

All society members are eligible to run for a role on the committee. The elections run throughout this week and next week. Those who want to run for a position can nominate themselves on the [Guild website](https://guildofstudents.com/vote), until Friday 24th April, 4pm. The nominated members are then voted in between 12pm on Monday 27th and 4pm on Wednesday 27th April. Voting will also take place on the Guild website.

Although we, as committee members, all work together in one big team, each role also has its own individual responsibilities - from taking care of the finances, to publicising all of the events. Being a committee member takes a lot of time and effort, but I would say it is definitely worth the outcome. The society, committee and our elections are governed by our Constitution, which you can read in full [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J3_EWs3dd2gq5T_xYylcP5pDzm0HHAYCTgiqKUYwkls/edit).

## President

The role of the President of the society is one of the most important in the society. The President chairs committee meetings and coordinates with the rest of the committee to make sure events happen. They also represent the group and liaise with the Guild, and chair the AGM and any EGMs.

Traditionally, the President has been the one to give speeches at various events, such as welcoming the Freshers at the Welcome Talks, and at the Christmas Meal and Ball.

## Treasurer

The Treasurer looks after the finances of the society. They communicate and advise with the committee to regularly report on the financial status, so that events can be run effectively. They also liaise with the Student Groups department within the Guild so as to maintain the group's accounts.

They also prepare applications for grants and funding, as well as budgets to support the finance of the society. The Treasurer also maintains an inventory of our equipment and hardware lab.

So I got myself involved in the elections and thanks to our members I've been the treasurer of CSS for the past two years. The most rewarding part of it has to be knowing that I contributed to so many successful and enjoyable events. It is a unique kind of fulfilment when you see members of a community having a great time and knowing you helped to make it happen. It was also an opportunity to gain experience in the world of accounting, finances and the logistics behind event planning. I had to hone some skills and learn some things that may very well come in handy in my career. Unfortunately, my journey is over, as I'm due to graduate this year, but I rest assured that the society will remain in good hands of my peers." %}

## Secretary

The role of the Secretary is to keep everything documented, by taking minutes in meetings between the committee, and at AGMs and EGMs. They also maintain and keep members and their memberships up to date, and correspond with members. They ensure that group promotions and activities also encourage and increase awareness of participation.

The Secretary also works with the Guild Student Groups department to ensure all of the records are kept current.

One of my fave parts about this year has been being able to step back and support the committee, rather than taking a leading role, and see all of the awesome work they've done. One of the highlights has gotta be the incredible CSS Ball this year that Lauren spearheaded!" %}

## Vice-President
