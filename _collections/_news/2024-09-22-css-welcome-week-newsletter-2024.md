# Welcome CSS members, to a new year of UoB

To start off another year full of fantastic CSS events, we're running 2 weeks full of freshers activities to get involved with, with lots to do, even if you aren't a first year!

Aside from mixers, everyone's free to attend any timetabled event below!

Here are some big ones open to everyone coming up soon:


## Board games night — Monday 23rd September 6pm-11pm — CS Building

Come to the CS atrium for a night of board games and pizza! Get to know other people in CSS while you learn how to play something new! We'll also have a quiet room setup in room 222 if you'd like to take some time to relax in a quieter environment. Make sure to bring your student ID if you'd like to get alcohol at the event, and no need to bring your own, that's our job!

We will have board games ready on the night, but you're welcome to bring your own too! If you're planning on bringing your own games, let us know what you're bringing here: <https://cssbham.com/bgn>

If you're interested in what others plan to bring, you can check that out here: <https://cssbham.com/board-games>

Regarding pizza, if you have any dietary requirements you want us to account for, please fill out the form here: <https://cssbham.com/bgn-dietary-form> - we'll always have vegan, vegetarian and meat options available!


## CSS Scavenger Hunt — Tuesday 24th September 10am-4pm — UoB Campus

Learn the lay of the campus with CSS' scavenger hunt, find study areas and food outlets around the uni. Find us at our stall from 10am — 4pm once you've completed it in the CS building for an exclusive Old Joe Tex sticker! Join up with up to 5 other people and have fun exploring!
