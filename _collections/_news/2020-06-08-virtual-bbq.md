Every year, CSS hosts a summer BBQ. 

However, due to current events, we can't really invite everyone together and have one... ☹️

Don't worry! Our incredibly talented committee have come up with an incredibly exciting alternative!

**Introducing: the CSS Virtual BBQ 2020 🎊**  

The Virtual BBQ will be hosted on the CSS Discord Server and begin at **19:00 P.M.** on **Saturday 20th June**.

We have planned the following activities:

1. A phenomenal pub quiz with a computer science round! 🤓
2. A block-busting Minecraft building competition! The results of this contest will be announced later in the evening. 👷‍♀️
3. A huge, exciting and funny game of Quiplash. 📱
4. A MASSIVE game of Werewolf which our Special Events rep Jacob has agreed to host. 🐺

## Where do I sign up?

All you have to do is join the CSS Discord server and be there at *19:00 P.M.* on the *20th June 2020*.

We know that many of you haven't had a chance to meet up with your friends during lockdown. Let this Virtual BBQ be
your chance to have fun, chat with your friends and hopefully some new people and maybe even build something in Minecraft.

We can't wait to see you there! 😀
