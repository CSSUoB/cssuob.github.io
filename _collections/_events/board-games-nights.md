At least once a term we run a Board Games Night and/or a LAN Party in the School
of Computer Science! We always have drinks and pizza, with the School providing 
alcoholic drinks, and usually take up the Atrium and the Sloman Lounge.

While we have our own board games and some consoles, we encourage everybody to 
bring their own as well!        

These events are drop-in and you're free to arrive and leave at any time, though
you'll probably want to be around for pizza!
