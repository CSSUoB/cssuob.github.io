At the end of each semester we have our Christmas Meal, and the Summer BBQ!
These are typically our final event of each semester so it's always nice to come
together for one last time as a CS community.

The Christmas Meal usually takes place in a local pub with orders taken beforehand.
The BBQ is more relaxed, we encourage everybody to bring their own food / booze,
and we also run a charity raffle to give away some of the random stuff we've 
acquired throughout the years!
