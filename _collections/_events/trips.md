We run a trip to either Bletchley Park, or the National Museum of Computing, 
alternating every year.

This trip is usually on a weekend and lasts the whole day, with coach transport 
from campus.

We also heavily subsidise the trip using a combination of society funds and grants 
from the School of Computer Science and the Guild, so it's always worth coming 
along!
