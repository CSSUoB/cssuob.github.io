We run regular programming workshops for people to learn a new language or
framework, and we also encourage and help members with running their own
workshops!

Most of our workshops are aimed at all skill levels, though some may require
some pre-requisite knowledge. However, they're open to everybody, even
if you're not a computer scientist!
