We've teamed up with [AFNOM](https://afnom.net) to host weekly sessions
to teach you all the things university doesn't, which you'll need as a computer
scientist.

We cover topics ranging from the basics of using your shell, to advanced git and
containers and virtualisation.

You can find course materials at <https://missingsemester.afnom.net>.
