# Pterobyte

Pterobyte is the official alcohol-mascot of the Computer Science Society, illustrated by one of our former committee members, 
Leaf (LINK HERE).

They originated in 2019, when CSS members wore a purple dinosaur costume to the EPS Trophy sports day 
to motivate CS students. It was suggested in a committee meeting that the dino should become our mascot, 
and after workshopping some name suggestions, the name TeX was proposed. The name stems from the dinosaur 
't-rex', and is also a play on the typesetting system '[TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)'.
