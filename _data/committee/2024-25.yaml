      All aboard! My name is Holly, and I am your CSS President, conducting our wonderful committee and the society as a 
      whole this year. Whilst I am in charge of ensuring events and tasks run smoothly, I am also the face and voice for 
      the society, so please let me know if you have any concerns or questions. Outside of my presidential duties, I 
      enjoy story writing, coding mods for Minecraft, and drawing. Feel free to say hi if you see me on campus, and if 
      you have a cat, DM it to me on Discord. :)
