      Hello! I'm Matty, your treasurer, so I'll be handling the society finances and financial paperwork required to make sure the society can continue running amazing events for everyone! I'm going into my 5th year at UoB, 4th year in CS and a student rep so please do reach out if you have any concerns, general feedback or just fancy venting about something.

      Hey everyone - Shay here! I'm your elected First Year Rep - this means I'm here to represent the often unheard voice of first years within the CSS Committee,
      making sure that as a first year, you feel welcomed into the society and have fun participating in events alongside us!
      If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to DM me over on Discord!
