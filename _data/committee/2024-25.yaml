      Hey everyone - Shay here! I'm your elected First Year Rep - this means I'm here to represent the often unheard voice of first years within the CSS Committee,
      making sure that as a first year, you feel welcomed into the society and have fun participating in events alongside us!
      If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to DM me over on Discord!
