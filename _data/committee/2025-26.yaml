      Matt here, your Post-Graduate (Research) Rep (and boy am I good at "repping").
      I'll be looking out for all the research post-graduates over the year,
      as well as introducing CSS to all the new students in September.
      We've had such a good inclusion of PGT students in 2024/25 so I'm looking
      forward to keeping that going with fun events that are accessible to the needs
      of my cohort. I may be crazy, but I'll never be scary so always feel free to
      come over for a chat! #ILoveOSM
