      Hi guys, I'm Joe, and I'm back as the PGR Rep! This time, however, I'm actually a Ph.D. student, so I feel more equipped to represent our smallest, but still very important group! On committee, my main role is to represent our wonderful students studying hard for a Ph.D., as well as accommodating them and encouraging them to attend CSS' events. However, I'm always happy to chat to everyone, not just PGRs! Outside of uni work, you can find me Ballroom & Latin dancing, or enthusing over many, many insects.

      Hi! I'm Maddy, a PGT student studying AI and Machine Learning, and I'm excited to be your new PGT Rep this year.

My goal is to represent and support all PGT students, making sure everyone feels welcome, included, and heard.
      If you ever need anything or just fancy a chat, feel free to reach out but be warned I can talk for ages :)

      I'll be looking out for all the research post-graduates over the year,
      as well as introducing CSS to all the new students in September.
      We've had such a good inclusion of PGR students in 2024/25 so I'm looking
      forward to keeping that going with fun events that are accessible to the needs
      of my cohort. I may be crazy, but I'll never be scary so always feel free to
      come over for a chat! #ILoveOSM

      Howdy hey! I'm Jhundon, your Interim Postgraduate (Taught) Rep! I'm here to represent 
      and support the PGT students joining us at CSS. Whether you're facing academic hurdles, 
      feeling a little lost, or just want to get more involved,  all you got to do is send me 
      a message!

      I've been here since my undergraduate in CS four years ago and have met many amazing people 
      from both the society and the university. Without them, I wouldn't have found my love for 
      Immersive Technologies (mostly VR) and the amazing community we have here.
