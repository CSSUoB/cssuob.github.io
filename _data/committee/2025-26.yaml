      I am Amrit. Second year undergraduate!
      Lua is my favourite programming language, and is easily one of the best languages to ever be made. I also love to use C, C++, C#, Objective-C, Swift, TypeScript, and F#. I have a wide plethora of projects I have worked on and am currently working on, present for viewing on my GitHub (same username as my discord)
      Other than programming, I also love Model UN/International relations, volleyball, cooking, classic Japanese cars, and snowboarding!
      As an industrial liason, I am excited to work to help students get oppertunities in industry to hone their skills and gain experience and connections.
      I am looking forward to meeting and working with everyone!

      Matt here, your Post-Graduate (Research) Rep (and boy am I good at "repping").
      I'll be looking out for all the research post-graduates over the year,
      as well as introducing CSS to all the new students in September.
      We've had such a good inclusion of PGR students in 2024/25 so I'm looking
      forward to keeping that going with fun events that are accessible to the needs
      of my cohort. I may be crazy, but I'll never be scary so always feel free to
      come over for a chat! #ILoveOSM

      Howdy hey! I'm Jhundon, your Interim Postgraduate (Taught) Rep! I'm here to represent 
      and support the PGT students joining us at CSS. Whether you're facing academic hurdles, 
      feeling a little lost, or just want to get more involved,  all you got to do is send me 
      a message!

      I've been here since my undergraduate in CS four years ago and have met many amazing people 
      from both the society and the university. Without them, I wouldn't have found my love for 
      Immersive Technologies (mostly VR) and the amazing community we have here.
