      I'm Jacqui, the president of CSS! My role is to manage the society and
      committee, as well as represent CSS at the guild. When I'm not stressing
      out over responsibilities and deadlines, I spend a lot of my time playing
      RPGs and drinking iced lemon tea.

      Hi Iâ€™m Jake and this academic year I will be managing the societies finances.
      I am going into my 4th year and plan to spend it playing DnD, drinking, and completing the occasional assignment.

    role: Vice-President

      Hi everyone! My role this year is to make sure that all events run smoothly and that everyone feels included
      in our computer science community.
      I love organising events and networking. I am always looking for
      personal development and career opportunities, so if you are keen on talking about internships, CVs or interview
      prepping, I would love to help you!

      Hi, I'm Rob. Itâ€™s my job to make sure you have as much fun as possible
      by running social events and meetups! This year, I want more people coming to these. In
      the unlikely event that you canâ€™t find me in the Sloman lounge or in the labs, Iâ€™m probably
      either playing guitar or running along the canals.

  - name: Afarin Izadi
    role: International Student Rep
    bio: >
      I know all about the struggles of being an international student â€” like finding friends, understanding the culture,
      and homesickness. I'm here to help you make friends and to make everyone feel
      like they belong in our community. In my free time, I love sports, fashion design and talking about Elon Musk!

    role: Special Events Rep
    bio: >
      I ensure that all of our big social events (like the CSS Ball and the Christmas meal) run
      smoothly and that everyone has a good time. I hope to make all of our events special throughout the
      year! In my spare time, I drink wine and fence as part of the University's fencing team
      (sometimes concurrently).

      My role is to make everyone feel included and represented at all our events,
      no matter their background. I also help arrange our international events,
      making sure we offer a diverse set of activities for our whole community.
      Aside from this, I mostly waste time by watching
      horror movies and reading murder mysteries. Feel free to contact me with any suggestions or concerns!

    role: Sports Rep

      I encourage everyone (regardless of your level or experience) to take
      part in our sports and e-sports events! One of my goals this year is to increase the amount of people
      involved in e-sports. When time allows, I love to go to the gym, read books and play video games.

      Hello World! I'm Rhys, a first year degree apprentice and your First Year Rep. I enjoy anything to do with CS and many
      other things - from programming to cycling (sometimes I do both ðŸ˜‰). I'll be making sure that you feel welcomed as a first
      year, and that CSS is a cool place for you. Feel free to contact me and I'll be sure to get back to you. ðŸ˜‡

  - name: Dan Clark
    role: Post-Graduate (Research) Rep
    bio: >
      My job this year is to get more PhD and MRes students involved in CSS events.
      My research is in Cyber Security, focusing on the (in)security of
      Bluetooth. Outside of that, I enjoy competing in CTF competitions and
      Rock Climbing. I was the CSS PGT rep during my MSc back in 2016/17,
      then I went to work for a few years (and now I'm back)!
