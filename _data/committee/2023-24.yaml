      Hey! I’m Archer and I’m the CSS president. My role is to lead the society (read: take all the credit) and whip the committee into doing their jobs and getting everything done. I’ve had a blast at CSS events and being on the committee since I joined, and I hope I can help others have a brilliant time this year as well. In my free time I like to listen to musicals, play D&D, and obsess over roller coasters. Feel free to message me on discord or say hi if you see me around campus! 🎉

      Hello! I'm Matty, your treasurer so I'll be handling the society finances and financial paperwork required to make sure the society can continue running amazing events for everyone!
      I'm a second year CS student and I'm also the most senior student rep - representing all 27,000 Undergraduate students to the University Senate.
      My interest in CS started with programming Minecraft plugins nearly 8 years ago but since then I've also gotten into cyber security as well. I also enjoy Jiu Jitsu and would love to get more people involved!

      Hey! I’m Ella, a 2nd year CS student. In my role as Secretary I’ll be minuting and keeping the committee organised and on task, as well as anything else I can help out with. Outside of CSS I play bass, have an endless amount of crochet projects, and pick up various random hobbies weekly. Please come say hi if you see me around!

      Hi I'm Charlie, the vice-president for CSS. This means I pick up any odd jobs that need to be done if other commitee members don't have the time. My hobbies outside of Computer Science are reading Science Fiction (with my favourite book being Brave New World) and I love listening to music, so feel free to come up to me to talk about those or anything else you'd like to discuss.

      Hey there! I'm Abi, and am going into my second year of CS at UoB. My
      role within CSS this year is basically to make sure you know what we're
      up to - be that through our Discord, Instagram or even our website.
      When I'm not dealing with that, you can find me programming, playing with
      old film cameras in the darkroom or making things.
      If you ever see me around, feel free to say hi! You're also welcome to
      drop me a message on Discord whenever! 😁 🏳️‍⚧️

      Heyo! I'm Vishwas, and I'm in my third year of CS at UoB. As your international rep, it's my job to make sure
      everyone feels at home at UoB. When I'm not dabbling in esoteric programming languages or tinkering with
      electronics, you'll find me raving about planes and trains. Feel free to stop me for a chat if you see me around 
      or ping me on Discord!

      It may be short-lived, but the time we'll spend together will be memorable. Matt here,
      your interim PGT Rep (and boy am I good at "repping"). I'll be looking out for all the
      taught post-graduates over the summer, as well as introducing CSS to all the new
      students in September. We've had such a good inclusion of PGT students in 2022/23 so
      I'm looking forward to keeping that going with fun events that are accessible to the
      needs of my cohort. I may be crazy, but I'll never be scary so always feel free to
      come over for a chat! #ILoveOSM
