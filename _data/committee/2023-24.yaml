      Hey there! I'm Abi, and am going into my second year of CS at UoB. My
      role within CSS this year is basically to make sure you know what we're
      up to - be that through our Discord, Instagram or even our website.
      When I'm not dealing with that, you can find me programming, playing with
      old film cameras in the darkroom or making things.
      If you ever see me around, feel free to say hi! You're also welcome to
      drop me a message on Discord whenever! 😁 🏳️‍⚧️
