      Hello! I'm Matty, your treasurer so I'll be handling the society finances and financial paperwork required to make sure the society can continue running amazing events for everyone!
      I'm a second year CS student and I'm also the most senior student rep - representing all 27,000 Undergraduate students to the University Senate.
      My interest in CS started with programming Minecraft plugins nearly 8 years ago but since then I've also gotten into cyber security as well. I also enjoy Jiu Jitsu and would love to get more people involved!

      Hey there! I'm Abi, and am going into my second year of CS at UoB. My
      role within CSS this year is basically to make sure you know what we're
      up to - be that through our Discord, Instagram or even our website.
      When I'm not dealing with that, you can find me programming, playing with
      old film cameras in the darkroom or making things.
      If you ever see me around, feel free to say hi! You're also welcome to
      drop me a message on Discord whenever! 😁 🏳️‍⚧️

      Howdy gang! I'm Holly and I am in my 3rd year of the MSci Computer Science
      degree. I am the Industrial Liaison for CSS this year, so I will be in charge
      of reaching out to companies for sponsorships and helping industrial opportunities
      reach you. Outside of that, I enjoy making mods/plugins for Minecraft, digital art,
      and doing Karate. I'm often around on Discord, so don't be afraid to say hi!
