      Hello, hello! I'm Matthew and I'm your CSS President! It's my job to keep things running
      smoothly and to keep the rest of committee on top of their tasks! I've had a great time
      planning, running, and attending events so far, so now I just have to return the favour!
      Outside of CSS I like to work on whatever soon-to-be abandoned project my brain will focus
      on, as well as sleep 24/7 (especially when it helps me avoid my responsibilities).

      Hey! I’m Archer and I’m the CSS president. My role is to lead the society (read: take all the credit) and whip the committee into doing their jobs and getting everything done. I’ve had a blast at CSS events and being on the committee since I joined, and I hope I can help others have a brilliant time this year as well. In my free time I like to listen to musicals, play D&D, and obsess over roller coasters. Feel free to message me on discord or say hi if you see me around campus! 🎉

      old film cameras in the darkroom or making things.
      If you ever see me around, feel free to say hi! You're also welcome to

      It may be short-lived, but the time we'll spend together will be memorable. Matt here,
      your interim PGT Rep (and boy am I good at "repping"). I'll be looking out for all the
      taught post-graduates over the summer, as well as introducing CSS to all the new
      students in September. We've had such a good inclusion of PGT students in 2022/23 so
      I'm looking forward to keeping that going with fun events that are accessible to the
      needs of my cohort. I may be crazy, but I'll never be scary so always feel free to
      come over for a chat! #ILoveOSM
