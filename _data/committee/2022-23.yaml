      Hello! I'm a final year Computer Science student and my role is to lead the society and manage the committee to help everything get done. üéâ CSS members may recognise me from the many CSS quizzes I've written and hosted, all with a glass of wine in my hand üç∑ In my spare time I like to play D&D, win at board games, and travel. I've been on the committee for three years now and I've met my best friends through CSS, feel free to reach out on the Discord or say hi in person <3

      Hey, I'm Juozas and I am currently on a Year in Industry. I'm the treasurer, meaning I keep track of the money that CSS 
      deals with and help with making events happen! When not in an office in the city centre, I like to read fantasy and SF 
      (if you have any recommendations, let me know!); make computer hardware do stuff it was never meant to; and try to form 
      the ultimate ritual to make the perfect cup of coffee.

      just hanging around CS. If I'm not working, I'm probably programming in my spare time, playing video games or listening 
      to a lot of music. Feel free to come to me if you need anything!
