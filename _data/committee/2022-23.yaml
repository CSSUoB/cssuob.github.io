      Hiya! My role in the society is to help out where I can across all committee positions and make sure that everyone is 
      doing well. CSS members will know me from hosting a bunch of Workshops, posting plenty of memes in the CSS Discord or 
      just hanging around CS. If I'm not working, I'm probably programming in my spare time, playing videogames or listening 
      to a lot of music. Feel free to come to me if you need anything!
