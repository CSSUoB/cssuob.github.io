    role: President
    bio: >
      As the president of CSS, I oversee and manage the committee and the
      society. I also engage in the recreational sport of watching paint dry,
      play video games, hear grass grow, and laugh at the futility of time.

      I'm Tom, a 2nd year PhD student here at the uni. I did my BSc here too,
      and I've been involved with CSS since my first year, and was president
      from 2016 to 2019 - I'm the secretary this year, and looking forward to
      meeting y'all! ðŸŽ‰

    role: Treasurer
    bio: >
      As Treasurer, I look after the finances of our society, ensuring every
      transaction is made by the book. Some would say the computer science
      building is my second home as people can often find me in the labs at
      unusual hours.

  - name: Justin Chadwell
    role: Vice-President
    bio: >
      My job within the committee is to help the society run smoothly, so I
      do lots of odd jobs, like work on this website. When not on CSS
      business, I'm taking part in hackathons across the UK, hacking with
      AFNOM, or spending too much time on assorted projects.

    role: Socials Rep
    bio: >
      As CSS socials rep, I ensure that social events occur frequently and
      that these events are designed around our members. When Iâ€™m not
      organising events, Iâ€™m often found wasting my time on configs.

    role: Special Events Rep
    bio: >
      As Special Events rep, I'm responsible for making sure that all big CSS
      events during the year, such as the CSS ball, are the best they can be.
      Outside CSS I enjoy dancing and playing in a steel drum orchestra.

    role: Diversity and Inclusivity Rep
    bio: >
      Iâ€™m the Diversity, Inclusivity and Equality Representative, or as I
      like to be called, the DIE rep for CSS. When Iâ€™m not doing nerdy comp
      sci stuff, Iâ€™m usually binge watching shows or eating carrots from
      Tesco.

    role: Sports Rep
    bio: >
      Within the committee I organise any sporting events, not forgetting
      e-sports. In my free time I play ice hockey, cycle and do and any other
      sports I fit in. I also love a host of classic and recent video
      games which I can't wait to bring to CSS.
