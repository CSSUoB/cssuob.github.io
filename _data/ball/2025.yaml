faq:
  - question: What is a Ball?
    answer: A ball is a solid or hollow spherical or egg-shaped object that is kicked, thrown, or hit in a game. <br><br> Ok but seriously, a Ball is an opportunity to come together and celebrate the year. Many societies hold them for their members and we're no different. Our annual Ball is the biggest night of the year so if you're not attending you're really missing out.
  - question: What will be there?
    answer: The ball will have a 3 course meal, a bar, and a dancefloor. We will also have some bangin' tunes, a photobooth, and a photographer.
  - question: When can I buy tickets?
    answer: Right now! Head over to the <a href=/ball/2024/#tickets> tickets section </a> for more details!
  - question: How much do tickets cost?
    answer: We have a number of different ticket options available and all of our member tickets are cheaper than the last 2 years! The Guild will also add on a £1 booking fee - There's nothing we can do about that sadly. Take a look at the <a href=/ball/2024/#tickets> tickets page </a> for more details. 
  - question: Can I bring a guest?
    answer: Absolutely! Non-Member tickets will be available alongside member tickets. If your guest is not a student they will need to create a guest account on the Guild website. If they're a current student but just on a leave of absence they can get membership prices, but will need to follow the steps <a href=/membership>here</a>.
  - question: Will I need to show my ticket when I arrive?
    answer: No, but we will ask to see your student ID or any other form of ID to confirm your identity. You'll then be given a wristband so you can come and go as you wish.
  - question: What time should I arrive?
    answer: You are welcome to arrive any time from 7pm onwards, but we ask you to arrive no later than 7:45 as we expect to begin dinner service at 8pm.
  - question: Who will I sit next to for dinner?
    answer: We'll ask you for the names of up to 2 people who you would like to sit near. We'll try our best to sit people near their friends, but we can't make promises you'll be next to both.<br><br> If you bring a +1 we will make sure you're sat with them, but we can only do this if you say so in the seating preference or contact us separately.
  - question: What about my dietary requirements?
    answer: The venue can handle catering for most dietary requirements, and there are vegan and gluten free options. Make sure to let us know any dietary requirements when you purchase your ticket. For more info on the menu please check the menu page <a href=/ball/2024/menu> here </a>.
  - question: What should I wear?
    answer: Dress to impress! <br>Don your fanciest frocks, smartest suits or whatever you feel fabulous in. It's going to be the big night of the year so feel free to go all out!
  - question: Will I be photographed?
    answer: Yes. We'll have a photographer taking photos all night so we can share them all with you afterwards. If you don't want to be in photos, please speak to our lovely photographer on the night or email us in advance.
  - question: I bought a ticket but can't attend anymore.
    answer: Oh no! That's okay though. You're welcome to sell your ticket to someone else, though we will not be able to offer a refund, nor are we able to change the meal options or dietary requirements once a ticket has been purchased. Please also contact committee to let us know who you've sold your ticket to.
