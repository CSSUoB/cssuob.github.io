faq:
  - question: What is a Ball?
    answer: A ball is a solid or hollow spherical or egg-shaped object that is kicked, thrown, or hit in a game. <br><br> Ok but seriously, a Ball is an opportunity to come together and celebrate the year. Many societies hold them for their members and we're no different. Our annual Ball is the biggest night of the year so if you're not attending you're really missing out.
  - question: What will be there?
    answer: The ball will have a 3 course meal, a bar, and a dancefloor. We will also have a live band, a photobooth, and a photographer.
  - question: When can I buy tickets?
    answer: Ticket sales have sadly now closed but we hope to see you there in 2024!
  - question: How much do tickets cost?
    answer: Tickets are £42.50, same as last year's. The Guild will also add on a booking fee - we can't do anything about that.
  - question: Can I bring a guest?
    answer: Absolutely! As long as you are a CSS member, your guest doesn't need to be. Just buy an extra ticket on the Guild website for your plus-one.<br><br><b>Please purchase +1 tickets separately from your main ticket. Due to an error with the Guild's system, you will not be able to choose meal choices for your guest if you buy them both at the same time.</b>
  - question: Will I need to show my ticket when I arrive?
    answer: No, we'll have a list of everyone who has bought a ticket. Just give your name on the door and you'll be issued a wristband.
  - question: Who will I sit next to for dinner?
    answer: We'll ask you for the names of up to 2 people who you would like to sit near. We'll try our best to sit people near their friends, but we can't make promises you'll be next to both.<br><br> If you bring a guest we will make sure you're sat with them, but please be sure to put them in as your seating preference.
  - question: What about my dietary requirements?
    answer: Fazeley Studios can handle catering for most dietary requirements, and there are vegan and gluten free options. Make sure to let us know any dietary requirements when you purchase your ticket.
  - question: What should I wear?
    answer: Dress to impress! <br>Don your fanciest frocks, smartest suits or whatever you feel fabulous in. It's going to be the big night of the year so feel free to go all out!
  - question: When do I need to get there?
    answer: Doors will open at 6:30pm so aim to arrive around then for the drinks reception. Dinner will start at 7:30pm, so please don't arrive later than that.
  - question: Will I be photographed?
    answer: Yes. We'll have a photographer taking photos all night so we can share them all with you afterwards. If you don't want to be in photos, please speak to our lovely photographer on the night.
  - question: I bought a ticket but can't attend anymore.
    answer: Oh no! That's okay though. You're welcome to sell your ticket to someone else. All that we ask is that you sell them at a reasonable price, and you let a committee member know. It may not be possible to accommodate dietary requirements for tickets you buy too close to the Ball.
