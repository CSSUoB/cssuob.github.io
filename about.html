        <p>CSS is part of the <a href=/guild>Guild of Students</a>, the University of Birmingham's student union. Like all Guild student groups, this means we 
        have a Constitution which formally lists the aims of the society along with the responsibilities of our committee members. We are keen to make the society 
        and its organisation open and transparent to all of our members so both the constitution and the agendas of our weekly committee meetings are linked below.</p>
